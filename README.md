As a certified .NET CMS and Full-Stack Developer with over 20 years of experience, I bring a robust blend of technical expertise across CMS platforms, full-stack development, and cloud solutions. With certifications in Sitecore (9 and 10) and extensive hands-on experience with top CMS platforms like DotNetNuke, Sitefinity, Umbraco, and Kentico, I excel at building high-performance, content-rich applications tailored to diverse business needs. My full-stack capabilities in C#, ASP.NET, and JavaScript complement my CMS skills, allowing me to deliver scalable and responsive web and desktop solutions that provide engaging, user-centered experiences.

My development approach emphasizes quality, performance, and collaboration, focusing on crafting modular, maintainable code and leveraging Azure and DevOps practices to ensure efficient deployments. With a deep commitment to long-term client success, I prioritize building solutions that are flexible, secure, and optimized for growth.
